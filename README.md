 The file *simulation_functions.R* contains all functions used for the simulations in Section 4 of the article. The folder *simulation_1* contains the files to run the simulations for rejection rates under null and alternative hypothesis, and *simulation_2* the files for rejection rates under misspecification of the conditional distribution of X given Z. The code was run on a HPC cluster, and the files *simulation_1.R* and *simulation_2.R* generate the output for a single run of the simulations, with parameters depending on the variable *id*. Additional figures with different parameters for the simulations are contained in the folder *additional_figures*. The figures are generated with the file *simulation_plots.R*.
