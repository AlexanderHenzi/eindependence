Peter Gr√ºnwald, Alexander Henzi & Tyron Lardy (2023). Anytime-Valid Tests of Conditional Independence Under Model-X, Journal of the American Statistical Association, DOI: [10.1080/01621459.2023.2205607](https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2023.2205607), arXiv: [arXiv:2209.12637](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12637).
 
Code for the data application is given in the folder `data_application`. The file `simulation_functions.R` contains all functions used for the simulations in Section 4 of the article. The folder `simulation_1` contains the files to run the simulations for rejection rates under null and alternative hypothesis, and `simulation_2` the files for rejection rates under misspecification of the conditional distribution of X given Z. The code was run on a HPC cluster, with reproducible seed for the simulations, and the files `simulation_1.R` and `simulation_2.R` generate the output for a single run of the simulations, with parameters depending on the variable `id` and other parameters that can be passed as command line arguments as explained in comments in the files.

To reproduce all the simulations in the article and more (i) clone this repository on an HPC cluster (ii) adjust the email address, partition name, desired R module etc. in the files `sim_logistic_{1,2}_{array,collect,plot}.sh` in the directories `simulation_{1,2}/`
(iii) make sure that the following R packages are installed for the R module previously specified: ggpubr, ggthemes, ldbounds, MASS and tidyverse[^1]
(iv) from the main directory, submit the batch job `figure_reproduction.sh`, i.e. `sbatch figure_reproduction.sh`
(v) when the job finishes, the tables and figures can be found in the main directory. The default parameters for the figures in the article are `correlation = "pos"`, `not_penalize_rmle = FALSE`, and `q = 4`. For other values of these parameters (`correlation = "negative_cor"`, `not_penalize_rmle = TRUE`, or `q = 8`), the corresponding parameter is appended to the file name. For example, Table 1 corresponds to `table_1_eps05.txt`, Figure 1 to `simulation_alternative_eps05.pdf`, Figure 2 to `simulation_group_sequential_eps05.pdf`, etc.

To further experiment with simulations under the null and alternative, parameters can be manually adjusted in the bash file `figure_reproduction.sh`. For instance, the parameter combination `--export=q=8,corr="pos",pen="TRUE"` runs simulations for the rejection rates with dimension `q = 8`, positive correlation, and no penalization of the parameter of interest in the running MLE method.

For the reproduction of Figure 3, download the bike share data set from https://s3.amazonaws.com/capitalbikeshare-data/2011-capitalbikeshare-tripdata.zip and save it in the folder `data_application`. Executing the file `data_application.R` produces Figure 3 from the paper. Figure S2 can be reproduced with the file `simulation_2_tests.R`.

The table below gives an overview of the parameters in the files for reproducing all figures and tables in the article and supplement. Figures for other parameter combinations are contained in the directory `additional_figures`.

[^1]: If you are having trouble installing tidyverse on the cluster, you can also opt for a combination of: dplyr, tidyr, and purrr.
This should be manually changed in the files `simulation_1_plots_table.R` and `simulation_2_plots.R`.
